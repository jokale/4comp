# Four cards

This is the second project out of a series in the [16 Frontend Projects](https://dev.to/frontendmentor/16-front-end-projects-with-designs-to-help-improve-your-coding-skills-5ajl) by Matt Studdert. It has really helped me in strengthening my CSS skills but also being able to look at a design and being able to create a straight replica of a prototype. Which is a skill I will need to strengthen if I am to be a good frontend developer. 


Currently deployed here [Four cards](https://4comp.vercel.app/)

##### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
